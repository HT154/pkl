= Pkl Binary Encoding
include::ROOT:partial$component-attributes.adoc[]
include::partial$component-attributes.adoc[]

Pkl values can be encoded into a binary format.
This format is used for Pkl's non-JVM language bindings, for example, for its Go and Swift bindings.

The binary format is uses link:{uri-messagepack}[MessagePack] encoding.

== Primitives

All Pkl primitives turn into their respective MessagePack primitive.

|===
|Pkl Type|MessagePack format

|link:{uri-stdlib-Int}[Int]
|link:{uri-messagepack-int}[int]

|link:{uri-stdlib-Float}[Float]
|link:{uri-messagepack-float}[float]

|link:{uri-stdlib-String}[String]
|link:{uri-messagepack-str}[string]

|link:{uri-stdlib-Boolean}[Boolean]
|link:{uri-messagepack-bool}[bool]

|link:{uri-stdlib-Null}[Null]
|link:{uri-messagepack-nil}[nil]
|===

NOTE: Pkl integers are encoded into the smallest int type that the number will fit into.
For example, value `8` gets encoded as MessagePack `int8` format.

== Non-primitives

All non-primitive values are encoded as MessagePack arrays.
The first slot of the array designates the value's type. The remaining slots have fixed meanings depending on the type.

The array's length is the number of slots that are filled. For example, xref:{uri-stdlib-List}[List] is encoded as an MessagePack array with two elements.

|===
|Pkl type |Slot 1 2+|Slot 2 2+|Slot 3 2+|Slot 4

Like non-primitive values, object members are encoded as MessagePack arrays, where the first slot designates the value's type.
